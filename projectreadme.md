# Chatbot Testing Framework with Agentic Routing and RAG Integration

This project is an integrated testing framework for a chatbot that incorporates several advanced strategies, including:

- **Clear Testing Objectives:** Define what the framework is intended to achieve.
- **Web Data Collection & Content Summarization:** Fetch and summarize web data from provided URLs.
- **Dynamic Test Generation:** Generate variations of test cases using synonyms, typos, and permutations.
- **Active Learning & Adaptation:** Adapt the test suite using active learning from test failures.
- **Monitoring & Iteration:** Log test results and produce summary reports for ongoing monitoring.
- **Agentic Routing with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Use an LLM-based approach (with a fallback rule-based extraction) to determine which modules to run based on a user prompt.

## Overview

This project provides an integrated framework for testing a chatbot. It not only runs a set of core tests such as web data collection, dynamic test generation, and chatbot evaluation, but also leverages agentic routing based on user input. When the user provides a prompt, the system uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to determine which modules (or tasks) to run. If the LLM-based task extraction fails to return a valid JSON array of tasks, a fallback rule-based approach is applied.

The project is built with Python and uses libraries such as `transformers`, `sentence-transformers`, and components from `langchain_community` for vector storage and embeddings.

## RAG Technology Overview

**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** is an approach that enhances generative models by combining them with external retrieval systems. In our framework, RAG helps ground chatbot responses and agent routing by:
- **Retrieving** relevant information (or test modules) based on a user prompt.
- **Augmenting** the generative process with external context to provide more accurate, informed outputs.

By integrating RAG, the framework can decide which testing modules to execute based on the user’s instructions, making the testing process more flexible and dynamic.

---

## Project Architecture

The framework is modular and consists of several components:

- **Agent Routing Module:** Handles advanced agentic routing. Uses an LLM-based task extraction to determine which tasks to run and a fallback rule-based approach if necessary.
- **Configuration Module:** Manages configuration values (endpoints, file paths, API keys, etc.) using environment variables.
- **Logging Module:** Configures logging with a rotating file handler and console output.
- **Test Generation Module:** Generates dynamic test variations using synonym replacement, typos, and permutation logic.
- **Web Data Module:** Collects and summarizes web data using BeautifulSoup and Hugging Face’s summarization pipeline.
- **Main Module:** Orchestrates execution by first running the agentic routing based on user prompt and optionally running the full core testing framework.

## Modules Description

### agent_routing.py

This module is the core of the agentic routing functionality. It uses an LLM-based extraction function (using the `google/flan-t5-base` model) to parse the user’s prompt into a JSON array of task names. If the extraction fails, it falls back to a rule-based method. Based on the extracted tasks, it executes various modules:
- **Web Data Collection & Summarization**
- **Dynamic Test Generation**
- **Chatbot Testing & Evaluation**
- **Model-based Reflex Agent**
- **Learning Agent**

### config.py

This module centralizes configuration parameters. It loads sensitive information (API keys, endpoints) and file paths from environment variables, enabling flexible deployment without hardcoding credentials.

### logging_config.py

This module sets up logging with a rotating file handler and a console handler. It ensures that log files do not grow indefinitely and that log messages are formatted consistently.

### test_generation.py

The test generation module provides methods to create variations of test inputs. It uses:
- **Synonym Replacement:** Leveraging NLTK’s WordNet.
- **Typos Introduction:** Swapping adjacent characters.
- **Permutations:** Generating alternative word orders.
It also caches generated variations and includes functions to update tests based on failures.

### web_data.py

This module handles web data collection. It fetches webpage content using `requests` and BeautifulSoup, cleans it, splits it into chunks, and uses a summarization pipeline to condense the content.

### main.py

The main module ties everything together. It sets up logging, prints testing objectives, and then runs the framework in two modes:
1. **Agentic Mode:** The user is prompted to enter a command. The agent uses LLM-based task extraction (with fallback) to determine which modules to run.
2. **Full Core Framework Mode:** Optionally, the user can run the entire suite of core tests (web data collection, dynamic test generation, chatbot evaluation, etc.).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-chatbot-testing-project.git
   cd your-chatbot-testing-project
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you do not have a `requirements.txt`, you can install packages individually:

   ```bash
   pip install nltk transformers sentence-transformers langchain_community faiss-cpu openai
   ```

4. **Download NLTK Data:**

   The code automatically downloads the WordNet corpus. If needed, you can run:

   ```python
   python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('wordnet')"
   ```

---

## Configuration

The configuration is managed through the `config.py` module. You can set environment variables for:

- API endpoints and keys (e.g., `CHATBOT_ENDPOINT`, `CHATBOT_APP_ID`, etc.)
- File paths (e.g., `CSV_URL_INPUT`, `CSV_TEST_INPUT`, etc.)
- Test parameters (e.g., `MAX_QUERIES`, `EVALUATION_THRESHOLD`, etc.)

You can create a `.env` file or set the variables directly in your environment.

---

## Usage

1. **Running Agentic Mode Only:**

   When you run the project, it will first print the testing objectives and then enter agentic mode. The system will prompt you:

   ```
   --- Agentic AI Mode: Awaiting your prompt ---
   Enter your prompt:
   ```

   _Example prompt:_

   ```
   Could you execute chatbot testing and learning agent tasks?
   ```

   The system will use the LLM-based extraction (with fallback) to determine the tasks. If it extracts tasks like `["chatbot_testing", "learning_agent"]`, only those modules will run.

2. **Running the Full Core Framework:**

   After agentic mode, you will be asked:

   ```
   Would you also like to run the full core framework? (y/n):
   ```

   If you answer **y**, the system will run all pre-defined tests (web data collection, dynamic test generation, chatbot evaluation, etc.).

3. **Logs and Reports:**

   Test results and summary reports are saved to CSV and JSON files respectively. Check the log files (configured via `logging_config.py`) for detailed runtime information.

---

## Extending the Framework

- **Add New Tasks:**  
  To add new modules (tasks), update the task extraction list in `agent_routing.py` (and adjust the fallback rules) and implement your module.
  
- **Improve Task Extraction:**  
  You can further refine the LLM prompt or add more sophisticated fallback logic if needed.

- **Integration with RAG:**  
  The framework is built with an understanding of Retrieval Augmented Generation. You can integrate additional retrievers or adjust the LangChain vectorstore to suit your use case.

- **Configuration and Environment:**  
  Modify `config.py` to adjust parameters without changing the code.

## RAG Technology in This Project

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a key technology that this project leverages indirectly through the agentic routing mechanism. By using an LLM (in our case, a free model from Hugging Face) to process user prompts and extract task instructions, the framework simulates a retrieval process that determines the most relevant test modules to execute. While this implementation does not use a full retriever-generator fusion as described in academic RAG models, it employs similar principles:
- **Retrieval of Task Names:** The system “retrieves” tasks based on semantic similarity between the prompt and available task names.
- **Augmented Generation:** The selected tasks then guide which parts of the testing framework are executed.

This approach allows the system to be flexible and context-aware, similar to modern RAG systems.
